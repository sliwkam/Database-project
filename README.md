# Database-project for hotel industry.

**1.	Description of database functionality**

This database is part of the management system for a network of hotels. Consists of tables connected with each other by different 
types of relations. It is used for better hotels work organisation. Includes data for faster and more effective work and communication 
between employees. 
The database has many applications:
   - checking whether the client with the entered identifier exists in the database
   - calculating the amount due for the stay
   - showing number of reservations for each hotel
   - presenting the real number of visitors in hotels
   - creating the view that shows reservations whose arrival date is older than 50 days from the current day
   - removing 'obsolete' reservations
   - displaying the most frequently booked hotels
   - and many other which can be created for specific needs.
